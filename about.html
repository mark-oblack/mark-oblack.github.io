					<p>So you want to learn a little more about me? Well, here it goes! Back in high school and during my collegiate years, I never saw myself as the creative type. Majoring in mathematics education further refined my idea that my brain was more wired for logic rather than creativity. However, I began to dabble in Adobe Photoshop over 3 years ago. It started out with simple projects, such as selective coloring and toying around with a photo's hue and saturation. Shortly after, I began tackling new projects, such as designing poster layouts and face swapping.</p>
					<p>Fast forward a few months and I began to learn how to utilize the all-powerful Adobe Illustrator. While learning this tool was tricky in the beginning, I eventually got the hang of it through resources such as Lynda.com, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbqd2YmFeHMwxlj4NcN5zPQ">Zimri Mayfield</a> and Chris Spooner's blog, <a href="blog.spoongraphics.co.uk">Spoon Graphics</a>. Through these learning methods, I discovered my interest in flat design (in case you couldn't tell by the color palette used on my site). From there, I began practicing flat design through some sample pieces, many of which can be found on the <a href="logos.html">logos and flat design</a> page. Through Lynda.com, I was able to explore the basic concepts of graphic and digital design, such as typography, color and basic skills with the Adobe Creative Cloud suite.</p>
					<p>As of this past May, I completed a web design and development certification program through Duquesne University. In this program, I covered the basic web languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with concepts such as database management and UI/UX design. Since then, my focus has been primarily on learning the aspects of front end web design. When I'm not practicing building sites on my own, I'm covering a variety of topics through <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse.com</a>.</p>
					<p>During my brief time as a novice designer, I've learned the importance of practicing your craft as much as possible. Whether it be through side projects or assigned tasks, practice helps hone your skills and explore new design concepts. Additionally, I would encourage any aspiring designer to not be afraid of taking on new challenges. It can be scary navigating the unknow waters at first, but immersing yourself into a project that challenges your design skills can be so rewarding. While I'm currently focusing on learning web design, my eventual goal is to educate students on the wide scope of topics under the design umbrella.</p>
